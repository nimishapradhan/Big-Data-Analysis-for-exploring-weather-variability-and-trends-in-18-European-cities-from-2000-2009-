# Big-Data-Analysis-for-exploring-weather-variability-and-trends-in-18-European-cities-from-2000-2009-
Meteorological data is used to investigate weather trends in this study. The goal of this research is to analyze weather data to predict weather suited for outdoor activities. The challenge is using meteorological data to accurately and timely forecast daily climatic data. This study examines historical meteorological data for 18 European locations from 2000 to 2009. The dataset includes cloud cover, air pressure, solar radiation,precipitation, sunshine duration, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological variables. This study examines climate patterns over decades. The approaches used includetemporal pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques. This study improves our understanding of regional climate variability and its socioeconomic impact.The results show how weather patterns affect outdoor activity planning and place selection. This work contributes to the field of weather forecasting by demonstrating its potential impact on enhancing outdoor activities and promoting vacations in various weather conditions.
